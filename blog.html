				<h2> Junior Year Reflections/Lessons </h2>
				<h4> By Arushi Bandi. June 24, 2016 </h4>
				<p> So, this is kinda late for end-of-schoolyear reflections, but I was thinking back on my year while packing for a summer program I'm leaving for this weekend, and decided to write about it. I have this note on my phone with random "rules of life" where I remind myself not to do stupid things like leave your phone on silent when expecting an important phone call or bringing a jacket even though you're 150% sure you can tough out the 40 degree weather. </p>
				<ol>
					<li> <i> Don't be afraid to be alone. </i> This wasn't necessary an 11th grade lesson, more of a past-few-years development. This is kinda the result of just not caring anymore, but I think this year I became so much more confident as an individual and it showed itself in little ways, like not worrying if I had no one to talk to in class or to sit with at a after-school meeting, something I would've stressed about even last year. </li>
					<li> <i> Speak Up. </i> I can recall many experiences this year specifically where someone gave a suggestion or input in a discussion and in my head I thought "yeah, duh" and later on s/he was praised for it. I'm not saying you should say things to impress others, but I think even summarizing others' ideas or stating the obvious can sometimes go a long way. </li>
					<li> <i> First Impressions are Real. </i> This also goes along with the theme of not caring about some things anymore, but I think this year I definitely improved my capability of accurately judging people's personalities (and determinning whether or not I should pursue a friendship/any future contact) the first time I meet them. This may seem a bit cynical, but it's actually a useful time-saving skill. </li>
					<li> <i> There's no such thing as too much me time. </i> Last year I remember always wanting to go out and do something fun with friends whenever I wasn't busy, but this year I have more often chose to stay in my bed instead :). Partly because of more external stress, partly because I'm an introvert that gets completely drained from energy during social activities, but mostly because I've realized that spending time alone makes me feel so much more peaceful overall and choosing what to do is so much easier with just one person. </li> 
					<li> <i> How my brain works. </i> Probably thanks to standardized tests :( I've actually become pretty good at figuring out how to study certain subjects or how to stay focused at tennis and I am actually getting pretty good at being able to compartmentalize and control my thinking. Personaly improvements are good. </li>

				<h2> A Few Things I Wish Existed </h2>
				<h4> By Arushi Bandi. June 18, 2016 </h4>
				<p> One of my time-passing hobbies is to take random objects around the room and find a way to make them better. I have a Note on my phone with all the ideas I've ever came up with, but these are just a few from today. Also, I like writing stuff down in lists, so I think that will be the new style for this blog.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <i> 4-Wheel Hamper/Laundry Basket. </i> So, this blog post is a result of me dragging my 20-lb hamper clumsily to my room. I thought, "Hey, I wish hampers had wheels at the bottom so they were easier to move." And then I thought "Wow, I wish other things existed too - I should write a blog post about it!" </li>
					<li> <i> Women's jeans with pockets that have any sort of functionality and/or size. </i> Yes, I am bitter about this. I didn't come up with it today, but I couldn't leave it out. I have scoured the Internet for any women's jeans with pockets bigger than 3x3" and have found absolutely nothing. I hate carrying my phone/wallet in my hand (#firstworldproblems, I know) and I am just a believer of wearing clothes that are actually useful. </li>
					<li> <i> Night Light that makes your room look like the changing night sky. </i> I love night lights, and I am obsessed with astronomy - my friends get annoyed with me when it gets dark out and I decide to name every celestial object I possibly can. So, I think it would be super cool if there was a night light that could map the layout of your room and recreate the sky outside, getting darker/lighter at the same time. Or you could just open the window, but...</li>
					<li> <i> Touch Screen Mirror! </i> Ok, so I saw this product on Mashable's Snapchat that is a thin bar that you can put under your laptop screen that turns it into a touch screen. And... I am imagining some futuristic product like that for full-length mirrors which also have some modeling/AI built in so you can test outfits on them! </li>

				<h2> Summer Reading List </h2>
				<h4> By Arushi Bandi. June 13, 2016. </h4>
				<p> I used to be the kind of person who only read fiction books, but recently I've been becoming more interested in nonfiction. Sci-fi still remains my favorite genre, though. My Summer Reading List is mostly nonfiction books about a wide variety of topics, a few fiction books, and many books from Bill Gates reading list (oops) in no particular order, and I also shared the reason I wanted to read the books, in case the 0 people reading my blog wanted to know. </p>
				<ol>
					<li> <i> Seveneves by Neal Stephenson </i> I got this book off of Bill Gates' reading list and finished it last week, so technically it's not on my reading list anymore. I loved the characters and the plot twist at the end and being the geeky person I am, loved the technicalities about physics/space. </li>
					<li> <i> How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg </i> Because I think I'm right alot of th time, and just want to make sure. This book is also from Bill Gates' reading list. </li>
					<li> <i> The Mind Club: Who Thinks, What Feels, and Why It Matters by Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray </i> Reading about Psychology is fun. </li>
					<li> <i> Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything </i> Self-improvement books are good, especially when they can help you remember nonsensical facts for upcoming tests. </li>
					<li> <i> West with the Night by Beryl Markham </i> Because strong women setting records is cool. </li>
					<li> <i> Accelerando (Singularity) by Charles Stross </i> So a couple months ago, I was reading a book recommended to me by my aunt (Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan - great book by the way, also the cover glows in the dark, which is +10) and one of the characters talked about an idea called singularity and I loved her and thought her idea was cool, so I added this to my reading list. I also like reading about what other people predict to be the future of the human race. </li>
					<li> <i> The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell </i> I like thinking of ideas, and learning about how to think of ideas. </li>
					<li> <i> What the Dog Saw by Malcolm Gladwell </i> I started reading Blink and got about half-way through before the quarter ended and I had to write a book report on it, so I never finished it. Also reading nonfiction is hard sometimes. But I was interested in the topics Gladwell talked about, and this book has been described as a sort of summary of his others, so I put it on here.</li>
					<li> <i> The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution and the Origins of Complex Life by Nick Lane </i> Guess where I got this? If you guessed Bill Gates' Reading list, you're right. </li>
					<li> <i> Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation by Tim Brown </i> I'm one of those people whose dream is to come up with a great idea and found a start-up, so yeah, this book appealed to me. </li>
					<li> <i> The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert </i> Honestly, the reason I want to read this is because I read the advertising hook thing to it and I just wanted to know what the sixth extinction is and it didn't say, so now I have to find out. </li>
					<li> <i> The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism by Olivia Fox Cabane </i> Because who doesn't want to be liked by everyone? </li>
					<li> <i> The Rosie Project: A Novel by Graeme Simsion </i> I've never been a fan of romance novels or anything cheesy for that matter, so at first I didn't want to read this book, but what can I say? Bill Gates convinced me. </li>
					<li> <i> The Clay Lion by Amalie Jahn </i> This book seems like one I'd have loved as a kid because time traveling!! I can't wait to read the series as well. </li>
					<li> <i> Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand </i> I had to read Anthem by Ayn Rand sophomore year and to be honest, while I understand the point she tried to make, I felt as if I could have understood the moral just as easily if it was stated in one sentence. But I like reading people's views about human existence, so I decided to give it a try </li>
					<li> <i> Sapiens: A Brief History of Human Kind by Yuval Noah Harari </i> This seems like the kind of book my parents would read. I've heard so many different opinions from people about the transition from simple to complex biological life, so I wanted to learn more about it for myself. </li>
					<li> <i> The Atlantis Gene by A. G. Riddle </i> I love books where there's a couple people trying to save the whole world, and the basis of this seemed not too far-fetched, just enough to keep me interested. </li>					
				</ol>
				<p> I'm not sure how many of these I will make it through in the next three months, but I'm gonna try my best! </p>
