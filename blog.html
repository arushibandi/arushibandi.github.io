				<h2> Summer Reading List </h2>
				<h4> By Arushi Bandi. June 13, 2016. </h4>
				<p> I used to be the kind of person who only read fiction books, but recently I've been becoming more interested in nonfiction. Sci-fi still remains my favorite genre, though. My Summer Reading List is mostly nonfiction books about a wide variety of topics, a few fiction books, and many books from Bill Gates reading list (oops) in no particular order, and I also shared the reason I wanted to read the books, in case the 0 people reading my blog wanted to know. </p>
				<ol>
					<li> <i> Seveneves by Neal Stephenson </i> I got this book off of Bill Gates' reading list and finished it last week, so technically it's not on my reading list anymore. I loved the characters and the plot twist at the end and being the geeky person I am, loved the technicalities about physics/space. </li>
					<li> <i> How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg </i> Because I think I'm right alot of th time, and just want to make sure. This book is also from Bill Gates' reading list. </li>
					<li> <i> The Mind Club: Who Thinks, What Feels, and Why It Matters by Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray </i> Reading about Psychology is fun. </li>
					<li> <i> Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything </i> Self-improvement books are good, especially when they can help you remember nonsensical facts for upcoming tests. </li>
					<li> <i> West with the Night by Beryl Markham </i> Because strong women setting records is cool. </li>
					<li> <i> Accelerando (Singularity) by Charles Stross </i> So a couple months ago, I was reading a book recommended to me by my aunt (Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan - great book by the way, also the cover glows in the dark, which is +10) and one of the characters talked about an idea called singularity and I loved her and thought her idea was cool, so I added this to my reading list. I also like reading about what other people predict to be the future of the human race. </li>
					<li> <i> The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell </i> I like thinking of ideas, and learning about how to think of ideas. </li>
					<li> <i> What the Dog Saw by Malcolm Gladwell </i> I started reading Blink and got about half-way through before the quarter ended and I had to write a book report on it, so I never finished it. Also reading nonfiction is hard sometimes. But I was interested in the topics Gladwell talked about, and this book has been described as a sort of summary of his others, so I put it on here.</li>
					<li> <i> The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution and the Origins of Complex Life by Nick Lane </i> Guess where I got this? If you guessed Bill Gates' Reading list, you're right. </li>
					<li> <i> Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation by Tim Brown </i> I'm one of those people whose dream is to come up with a great idea and found a start-up, so yeah, this book appealed to me. </li>
					<li> <i> The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert </i> Honestly, the reason I want to read this is because I read the advertising hook thing to it and I just wanted to know what the sixth extinction is and it didn't say, so now I have to find out. </li>
					<li> <i> The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism by Olivia Fox Cabane </i> Because who doesn't want to be liked by everyone? </li>
					<li> <i> The Rosie Project: A Novel by Graeme Simsion </i> I've never been a fan of romance novels or anything cheesy for that matter, so at first I didn't want to read this book, but what can I say? Bill Gates convinced me. </li>
					<li> <i> The Clay Lion by Amalie Jahn </i> This book seems like one I'd have loved as a kid because time traveling!! I can't wait to read the series as well. </li>
					<li> <i> Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand </i> I had to read Anthem by Ayn Rand sophomore year and to be honest, while I understand the point she tried to make, I felt as if I could have understood the moral just as easily if it was stated in one sentence. But I like reading people's views about human existence, so I decided to give it a try </li>
					<li> <i> Sapiens: A Brief History of Human Kind by Yuval Noah Harari </i> This seems like the kind of book my parents would read. I've heard so many different opinions from people about the transition from simple to complex biological life, so I wanted to learn more about it for myself. </li>
					<li> <i> The Atlantis Gene by A. G. Riddle </i> I love books where there's a couple people trying to save the whole world, and the basis of this seemed not too far-fetched, just enough to keep me interested. </li>					
				</ol>
				<p> I'm not sure how many of these I will make it through in the next three months, but I'm gonna try my best! </p>
