      uhhhh sorry this page is not going to work for you if you didn't receive a
      special invite link from arushi herself. Or if you didn't follow the
      instructions to not refresh your tab!!! Or maybe this doesn't work idk
    </p>

    <div id="invite" hidden="true">
      <p>
        You have received an invitation to arushi & gabby's bday party 2023. I
        hate the corps, so I'm putting myself through this. You must use Chrome
        or Firefox for this experiment to work!
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm trying to use WebRTC APIs to create something vaguely like partiful,
        but way uglier and with no server?? or database??
      </p>

      <p>Because I hate myself. Cool let's get drunk June 17th!!!!</p>

      <p id="details"></p>

      <p>If you're not gonna show up ... never speak to me or my gabby again</p>

      <p>
        You may have to wait a few seconds or like 20 seconds for the rest of
        the page to load while you're ... connecting to my browser!!!
