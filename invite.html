    <p>
      You have received an invitation to arushi & gabby's bday party 2023. I
      hate the corps, so I'm putting myself through this. You must use Chrome or
      Firefox for this experiment to work!
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm trying to use WebRTC APIs to create something vaguely like partiful,
      but way uglier and with no server?? or database??
    </p>

    <p>Because I hate myself. Cool let's get drunk June 17th!!!!</p>

    <p>If you're not gonna show up ... never speak to me or my gabby again</p>

    <p>
      You may have to wait a few seconds or like 20 seconds for the rest of the
      page to load while you're ... connecting to my browser!!!
