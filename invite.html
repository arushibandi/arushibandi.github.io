      special invite link from arushi herself. Or maybe this doesn't work idk

      <h3 id="party" style="color: yellowgreen">!!!!!! PARTY TIME !!!!</h3>

      <p>
        You have received an invitation to arushi & gabby's bday party 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an experiment in creating partiful but without a backend server.
        I tried using only web p2p libraries but that didn't go well so instead
        I made a Figma file my database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I hate myself. Cool let's get drunk
        <em style="color: yellowgreen"> June 17th!!!!</em> We'll be partyin' a
        little then plan to go out to somewhere for a fun night & a long night.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p id="details">The party shall begin 8pm at</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you're not gonna show up ... never speak to me or my gabby again. You
        must bring something (it could be like, a good attitude or something)
      </p>

      <p>
        Bugs can be reported live at the time/place stated. You'll get to see
        the exclusive guest list only after rsvp-ing :)
      </p>

      <p>P.S this website is doing its best, please be patient as it loads.</p>

      if you really want to see the guest list without submitting the form again
      and bringing more stuff, ask arushi for the admin password. or read the
      source code and figure it out.
