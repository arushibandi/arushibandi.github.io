      uhhhh sorry this page is not going to work for you if you didn't receive a
      special invite link from arushi herself. Or maybe this doesn't work idk
    </p>

    <div id="invite" hidden="true">
      <h3 id="party" style="color: yellowgreen">!!!!!! PARTY TIME !!!!</h3>

      <p>
        You have received an invitation to arushi & gabby's bday party 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an experiment in creating partiful but without a backend server.
        I tried using only web p2p libraries but that didn't go well so instead
        i made a Figma file my database.
      </p>
      <p>Why? Because I hate myself. Cool let's get drunk June 17th!!!!</p>

      <br />
      <p id="details">The party shall begin 8pm at</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you're not gonna show up ... never speak to me or my gabby again. You
        must bring something (it could be like, a good attitude or something)
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do not report any bugs. You'll get to see the exclusive guest
        list only after rsvp-ing :)
