      <h3 id="party" style="color: yellowgreen">!!!!!! PARTY TIME !!!!</h3>

      <p>
        You have received an invitation to arushi & gabby's bday party 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an experiment in creating partiful but without a backend server.
        I tried using only web p2p libraries but that didn't go well so instead
        I made a Figma file my database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I hate myself. Cool let's get drunk
        <em style="color: yellowgreen"> June 17th!!!!</em>
      </p>

      <br />
      <p id="details">The party shall begin 8pm at</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you're not gonna show up ... never speak to me or my gabby again. You
        must bring something (it could be like, a good attitude or something)
      </p>

      <p>
        Bugs must be reported live at the time/place stated. You'll get to see
        the exclusive guest list only after rsvp-ing :)
      </p>
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id="rsvp" hidden="true">
      <form>
        <label for="pname">Who are you?</label>
        <input type="text" id="pname" />
        <label for="gift">What are you bringing?</label>
        <input type="text" id="gift" />
        <input
          type="button"
          id="partyBtn"
          value="ready2party"
          style="background-color: #db92ff"
          onclick="sendToArushi()"
        />
      </form>
      <p id="nicetry" hidden="true" style="color: rgb(139, 19, 63)">
        Nice try. you're gonna need to fill out the form to see who's coming.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="allRsvps">
      <ul id="theGuestList"></ul>

    <p>
      if you really want to see the guest list without submitting the form again
      and bringing more stuff, ask arushi for the admin password. or read the
      source code and figure it out.
