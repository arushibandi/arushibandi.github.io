					<h4>Perceptions and Realities of Online Profiling on Facebook</h4>
					<p> For the class Privacy Policy, Law, and Technology, I worked in a group project to study people's attitudes to Facebook's data collection on their profiles by asking them to look at their Ad Preferences on Facebook and take a pre- and post- survey. You can take a look at our winning poster <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13R6f9EB_ldP5Y4hg1593QK9ok0lL21ewQjr8kMKgBCU/edit?usp=sharing">here. </a> </p>

					<h4>A Natural Meal Adaptation</h4>
					<p> For my final project for the class Introduction to Physical Computing, I worked in a group to create an assistive device that was meant to address a problem in our client, an older person's life. However, after talking with Rosemarie (our older friend) for several hours, we realized that she was enjoying life to the fullest and did not really find anything to be too problematic. As a result, our group, Team Renfrew, decided to create a device that would incorporate two of Rosemarie's greatest fascinations: cooking and interactive art. We call our device: A Natural Meal Adaptation. This device simulates an LED light representation of a meal that Rosemarie is going to prepare, so she can set the mood while cooking. She can also refer to meals she has made before and be reminded of the beautiful light pattern that was displayed, and whether her husband Joe enjoyed that specific meal. You can read more about our project <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2018/work/team-renfrew-final-documentation/"> here </a>. </p>

					<h4>Fish Tank Surprise!</h4>
					<p> For the first project in the class Introduction to Physical Computing, we were given the following prompt - create a device that reacts to the user in a surprising way. We decided to create a mini fish tank that would ___ when the user fed the fish! This was a super fun and silly way to get started with basic Arduino skills for this class. You can read more about it, and see the surprise <a href="https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/60-223/s2018/work/project-1-fish-tank-surprise/"> here. </a></p>
