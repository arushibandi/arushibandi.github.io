    <h1> Software Intentions </h1>
    <h3>a personal framework for creating software that is self-hosted and user-owned; anti-corporate and
        anti-commercial.</h3>

    <p>For the Solidarity Infrastructures class at SFPC, I really struggled with thinking of what to
        create for my final project. Originally, I was hoping to share some progress from a side project for
        self-hosting data and applications. But with that project not quite in a demo-able state, I wanted to
        grapple
        more directly with the class content as I thought about our final output. </p>

    <p>I already tried, but I can't stop thinking about the Internet. I can't stop thinking about social media,
        what
        does it do to my brain, and I can't stop thinking about The Algorithm(s). I can't stop thinking about
        computing,
        the worldviews it evokes and imposes. This is an exercise in documenting what I've found so far, in
        starting to
        tie together loose threads I've kept with me over the last few years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is it possible to build ethical software given that so much of this field's primary motivations were
        rooted in
        the military-industrial complex, to create tools for control and surveillance? And the tech industry's
        clear
        alignment to profit at all costs / a warped vision of the future. What would ethical software even look
        like?
    </p>

    <p> I am concerned with these questions first as a student and lover of logic and math, and next as a
        software
        engineer trying to find her place in this industry and the world. These questions are also deeply
        personal: if
        it's not possible then, well, what am I doing? When I think about Solidarity
        Infrastructures, I guess I am asking, can a piece of software/network/internet infrastructure really be
        built in
        solidarity with humans?</p>

    <p>There is an emphasis in this industry to solve existing problems (oftentimes caused by the deployment of
        software) with more software. What is the new AI that's going to regulate all the bad AIs? But with each
        new
        tool, each call to build the fix or create a future, I find myself with an overwhelming sense of dread.
    </p>

    <p>I find myself feeling that there is too much software in the world, and I‚Äôm
        wary of adding to that pile. And yet, there is also a huge gap: there is no software to fill the
        decaying
        expanse of social media and lack of digital public spaces, there is not enough software that is easy to
        understand and easy to
        run on our own devices, and
        there‚Äôs not enough software that makes it easy to build software for non-commercial purposes. I was/am
        very much
        feeling the urgency of needing more non-corporate, secure tools to communicate over the internet, of
        needing new
        ways to create our own internet infrastructure, and doing this without adding to the junkyard of apps
        and
        installations. </p>

    <p>This is not to say I don‚Äôt believe in single-purpose tools, or one-off pieces of software, because I
        very much do. But when it came time to be inspired by one of these, I honestly just felt like getting
        off of my
        computer. Out of an irrepressible instinct to be
        very careful about what I put out into the world, I decided that for my final project, I wanted to
        instead
        collect
        and state my intentions for creating software in the future. I have an Are.na channel called ‚Äúguiding
        principle‚Äù
        - a
        collection of notes, writings, and sites that I find myself coming back to and continually finding food
        for
        thought.
        I hope this space becomes something similar, a growing archive of projects that have inspired me and
        continue to
        teach me how to create, as well as a set of guardrails to hold my motivations steady when I need to do
        so. </p>

    <p>I am calling this "Software Intentions"; a framework in which to consider new technology I build, and to
        judge
        the new technologies presented to me. Behind each intention is all the reading, internet stalking, late
        night
        journaling I've done on this topic, and I try my best to link back to some of the most influential of
        these.</p>

            title="During this class, spiders were for some reason a recurring theme in my life - I had several dreams involving spiders, I caught a spider in my apartment, and I went out to eat with a friend where the waiter pranked me with a Halloween spider, all in the course of a week. I started thinking about spiders as 'spinning a web' and how we were trying to do the same in this class. :)"
