  <p>☎️ Hi! You have reached the Internet home page of myself, Arushi Bandi. I am a technologist living and working in San Francisco. Most of this site is best viewed on non-mobile devices.</p>
  <p>💭 I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, working on <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/livegraph-real-time-data-at-scale/">LiveGraph</a>. </p>
  <p>😶‍🌫️ I've been spending a lot of time in the last couple of years learning and un-learning, largely through amazing classes at the School for Poetic Computation (<a href="https://sfpc.study/blog/reflections-on-machine-language">Machine Language '23</a>, <a href="https://infrastructures.us/en/blog/hiarushi/">Solidarity Infrastructures '24</a>) and the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/40pxqg9iudxw8mswnu5ch/Collective-Action-School-Yearbook-2023_7-12.pdf?rlkey=3808tjhzuveymzw5qdgrzvk95&e=1&st=vt9acabo&dl=0">Collective Action School</a>.</p>
  <p>🪩 Some of the things I've done in the past on the more fun side have been:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>designing & making the pieces for <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/project/obfuscate-fashion-in-an-age-of-surveillance">a fashion line</a> considering how we may one day dress for (against) a surveillance society which received a microgrant from the <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/frff-grants-microgrants">Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry</a></li>
    <li>teaching a class my senior year of college titled <a href="https://www.are.na/ash-band/class-logistics">The Way We Live Now</a>, interrogating the relationship between technology and our idea of personhood</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✏️ I've also engaged in a little bit of <a href="writings.html">writing</a></p>
  <p>🔭 And a little bit of <a href="experiments.html">experimentation & exploration</a></p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
