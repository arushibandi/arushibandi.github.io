  <p>Hi! You have reached the severely under-developed Internet home page of myself, Arushi Bandi. Every year, I consider not renewing this domain because truly, I have not done much with it. But there have been a few bigger moments in its lifetime, so I keep it around for old times and potential future times sake. I am currently a software engineer / technologist living and working out of San Francisco. </p>
    
  <p>Some of the things I've done on the more fun side have been designing & making the pieces for <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/project/obfuscate-fashion-in-an-age-of-surveillance">a fashion line considering how we may one day dress for (against) a surveillance society</a> which received a microgrant from the <a href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/frff-grants-microgrants">Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry</a>, teaching a class my senior year of college titled <a href="https://www.are.na/ash-band/class-logistics">The Way We Live Now</a>, which interrogated the relationship between technology and personhood, and participating in amazing classes from SFPC and Collective Action School.</p>
