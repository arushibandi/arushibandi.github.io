    <p>This is a (growing!) collection of code experiments and explorations I've created in the last couple years. In
        general, I'm trying to seek alternative ways of thinking about computing and create a space to ruminate on the
        idiosyncracies that come up in software. Oftentimes when dreaming about how I wish software was, I wonder,
        how hard could [idea] really be? Some of these experiments are an attempt to answer this question. I hope to keep
        challenging myself to putting these out into the world, opening them up to critique and conversation and
        remixing. </p>
        <p>These explorations betray the industry software engineer side of myself, the one that sees things clearly  as they are meant to be, that tries to understand code as it is rather than as I suppose or desire it to be. The other side of myself, always threatening to burst into the room, does not make sense of things this way. It makes metaphors where there should definitely not be any, turns every meaning into something else, draws conclusions the other half would be ashamed of. These projects are something of a weaving: One thread of thought clear on its matters of what things do, how they work, why they are, and the other one slipping in to ask, but is that really so? </p>
