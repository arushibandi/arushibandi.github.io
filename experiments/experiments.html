    <p>This is a (growing!) collection of code experiments and explorations I've worked on over the last few years. In
        general, I've created these to seek alternative ways of thinking about computing and ruminate on the
        idiosyncracies that come up in software. Oftentimes when I'm dreaming about how I wish software was, I wonder,
        how hard could [idea] really be? Some experiments are an attempt to answer this question. I hope to keep
        challenging myself to putting these out into the world, opening them up to critique and conversation and
        remixing. </p>
