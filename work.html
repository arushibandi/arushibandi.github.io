				<h3> EXPERIENCE </h3>
			</div>

			<div id="item">
				<h4>Qualcomm Technologies, Engineering Interim Program Intern </h4>
				<h6> eXtended Reality Software Team (XRSW), May-August 2018</h6>
				<p>Last summer, I worked as an intern on Qualcomm's XRSW team, which creates software for VR/AR computer chips supplied by Qualcomm. The motivation behind my project was to see if it was possible to stitch together existing technologies to predict 6DoF controller position from 3DoF controllers paired with a 6DoF headset with a variety of sensors on it. I created a ground truth system to collect training data for 6DoF controller pose prediction, including work in time alignment and data processing of various systems. I also worked with engineers to conceptualize appropriate paths to take for post-processing of the data/ML.</p>

				<h4>Neya Systems LLC, Robotics Intern</h4>
				<h6>Sept. 2016-Aug. 2017</h6>
				<p>At Neya, I worked on the following two projects: </p>
				<p><b>Remote Access Critical Care (RACC):</b> The goal of this project was to use computer vision techniques to connect remote physicians to soldiers on the field and aid with emergency care of injuries and wounds. I analyzed the existing algorithms used on this project, and improved feature extraction, matching techniques, object search and tracking algorithms as well as built end-to-end tests for quality and communications constraints. </p>
				<p><b>Augmented Reality Medical Education Tool for Anatomy (AR-META):</b> The idea of this project was to enhance classroom medical education through the use of AR on live patients or models. I worked on integrating an AR Tag detector and pose estimation to overlay simple models and get this project running.</p>

			<div id="item">
				<h4> A* Search Approach to The Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows</h4>
				<h6>Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Sciences, Summer 2016 (Team of 9)</h6>
				<p>At the 2016 Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Sciences, I was part of a ten person team working on a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem known as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The objective is to find the most efficient route for a number of trucks to make deliveries to given locations with specific delivery time windows. Our approach solved eight instances of VRPTW as efficiently as world record solutions. You can read our paper <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WZAfMBgJY8KUZRvIaZC3Sl6xt89sISK0HLtGag5y9E/edit">here.</a>

				<h4>Using NLP to Improve Prediction of Relevant Data In Electronic Medical Records</h4>
				<h6>University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Summer Academy, Summer 2015 </h6>
				<p>At The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's Summer Academy, I worked on a project to generate predictions of relevant lab tests a physician ask for from patients. My approach used a logistic regression classifier from a combination of features from Natural Language Processing of patient medical records  and their clinical features recorded at the hospital. </p>

				<h4>DROOM!</h4>
				<h6>15-112 Fundamentals of Programming Term Project, Fall 2017</h6>
				<p>For my term project in this class, I created a small application that used OpenCV and webscraping to automatically generate room decorations and furniture in proper locations given an image of a room and users preferences. Watch the video I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbEPeGGlOmg&feature=youtu.be"> here.</a></p>
