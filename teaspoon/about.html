            <h4 class="mb-0">what is teaspoon?</h4>
            <p>teaspoon is a program I put together for my final project for <a href="https://school.logicmag.io">
                    Collective Action School (prev. Logic
                    School)</a>.</p>
            <p>It works much like the social media we are all so familiar with: you can post, and you can view a feed.
                However, there are a few critical differences to teaspoon:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The teaspoon server is running completely on my old laptop (a 2017 MacBook Pro with a butterfly
                    keyboard), and all the data created by posting to teaspoon lives there, on a shelf in my kitchen.
                </li>
                <li> There's exactly 4 WAU: me, my mom, my dad, and my brother. </li>
                <li> There's no algorithm, no ads, no shadow banning. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's a little demo!

                            In my day job as a back-end software engineer, I tend to be fairly removed from the choices
                            designers make. Ironically, thinking about software <a
                                href="https://mogami.neocities.org/files/gadget.pdf">lock-in</a> and how different
                            design affordance affect the way we think (and therefore who we are ???) is what first
                            inspired more independent thinking about software & the tech industry on my part, back in
                            college.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Even
                            in an app as small as this, there were a lot of aesthetic and functional decisions I had to
                            make (how
                            should I display the feed? should I even use a feed? what does this display emphasize?),
                            which again solidified my desire for more <a

                            One thing I had really fun with was messing around with open-source fonts and learning some
                            basic design
                            & color theory principles, even if the end result doesn't show that üôÉ

                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <a>Small details like getting this emoji cursor to work took an unreasonable amount of
                                time, but made me very happy.</a>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>"spoonfed", because it sounds kinda like "spoon feed". IDK, software naming is weird.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>"teaspoon" because tailscale services auto-prefix with "ts", so my original directory was
                            "tsp". I thought it was silly goofy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The actual site for teaspoon is inaccessible for anyone not authenticated to my private network, hence
                the video demo.</p>
            <p>The private network for teaspoon was set up using <a href="https://tailscale.com">tailscale</a>!
                I
                created a <a href="https://tailscale.com/glossary/tailnet">tailnet</a> with two users, myself
                and a
                shared email account I could use for the rest of my family, to spare them from having to manage another
                account. </p>

            <p>Prior to using tailscale, I experimented with a bunch of different methods to grant access to the
                teaspoon server from other devices. I tried a combination of manual input from different users
                plus
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)">NAT hole punching</a>, but
                turns out this is pretty hard to do, and tailscale takes care of loads more than routing, like managing
                dynamic IPs,
                authentication, and end-to-end encryption for free (for up to 3 users).

            <h4 class="mb-0">why teaspoon?</h4>
            <p>After I downloaded teaspoon onto my dad's phone, he asked me, "so, tell me, how is this different from uh
                ...
                iMessage?" I'm still working on an answer for that.</p>
            <p>Simply? Well, because I don't think we should sacrifice control of our data and privacy for convenience,
                branding,
                and ignorance to what we really give up when we do so. Maybe this is a start.</p>
            <p>
                I worked on this project largely as a stepping stone and learning experience in how we can make
                locally-hosted, small-scale and community software projects more accessible and easier to set up. I mean
                this both in the sense of taking back data ownership from big corporations and thinking about what
                different software might exist in the world if people who use it have a stake and say in its the
                development.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because I was low-key cramming to finish this up and my front-end skills are lacking, I ended up with a
                simple post+feed as the final design. I would love to re-visit this in time and I hate that this was the
                path of least-resistance for my mind.

            <h4 class="mb-0">digressions</h4>
            <p>
                Throughout the brainstorming, experimenting, and coding for this project, there were a few themes I kept
                coming back to.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">ü´ñ</p>
            <p>One of these was the idea of <b>threat models vs. trust models</b>. In traditional software
                systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model">threat modeling</a> is the process by
                which companies assess security risk and structural vulnerabilities. I think one of the biggest pain
                points of self-hosting today is understanding and managing these risks -- keeping security keys and
                secrets private and
                ensuring that your server is not accessible by malicious actors. Fortunately
                for this project, all of that (besides a few pre-emptive ACL rules) were managed by tailscale. The
                existence of this secured private network <i>essentially for free</i> was the reason I felt safe hosting
                it on my computer. This got me thinking about <b>trust models</b>. </p>
            <p>
                When the security problem of self-hosted software falls away (assume only properly authenticated &
                authorized people have access
                to my program), what's
                left in terms of risk are the people already in my network, and the security of their devices. Ignoring
                the latter, this poses a predicament wholly different to that which a "software" "company" deals with on
                a
                regular basis. Namely, do I trust that the people I have privileged to use the software I'm running will
                use it with some level of discretion, which is only vaguely etched somewhere in my mind. The biggest
                "threat" to my software is probably someone I've trusted to use it. When reasoning about the software
                from this perspective, it reinforces the interdependence of the people using it on each other:
                maintaining it falls on everyone, rather than trusting unknown people and hoping for the best. (it would
                be impossible to come up with a threat model of my personal data that's been spilled out into the
                world's data servers)
            </p>
            <p>I want to emphasize again that this type of speculative reasoning was really only possible because
                tailscale took care of so many of my needs for free.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">ü´ñ</p>
            <p>This relates to the other idea that's been playing on my mind: the <b>intentional misuse</b> of existing
                software and
                APIs. Recently, I read <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi_jJL-97eDAxUCFlkFHfOlDMEQFnoECC4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.macmillan.com%2Fbooks%2F9780374539184%2Feverythingineedigetfromyou&usg=AOvVaw3mIi2zFfyzIIyUaqBRVAib&opi=89978449">
                    this book </a> about, as the subtitle states, "How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It",
                mostly on
                platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr. These platforms shaped fandoms and in turn they shaped the
                platform and even larger internet culture, largely by misusing them to get what they wanted
                e.g. trending takeovers to get noticed. Back in June, right around the time <a
                    href="https://school.logicmag.io">
                    Logic School</a> was ending, I hosted a birthday party. Similar to the lines of thinking in this
                project, I wondered -- how hard can it really be to make my own p2p version of <a
                    href="https://partiful.com">partiful</a>. Turns out, kinda hard. </p>
            <p>Anyways, I ended up deeply misusing <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/api">Figma APIs</a> to use
                a Figma file as a database and file comments as rows, leaking an API key everytime I sent out
                the invite. The vestiges of this still exist on <a href="https://www.arushibandi.com">on my website</a>,
                for memories. (This little invite was built on the trust model that no one I shared a link with would
                share it with someone ~suspicious~).</p>
            <p>
                This concept isn't new, but I found that there's something that feels subversively empowering about
                using platforms this way. As if I could use it to my benefit rather than being used by it, with full
                knowledge that I'm exactly the type of "low-quality user" (someone who uses a service but doesn't pay
                for it or generate much revenue) that they despise. How can we <b>intentionally misuse</b> the existing
                software out there to build new systems, free from their control? Is this even possible?
